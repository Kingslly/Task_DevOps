I modified an existing Terraform setup by adding a CloudWatch Log Group and associating it with Lambda functions, ensuring changes were non-disruptive and thoroughly tested before deployment.

resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "lambda_logs" {
  name              = "/aws/lambda/${var.lambda_name}"
  retention_in_days = 14
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "my_lambda" {
  function_name = var.lambda_name
  handler       = "index.handler"
  runtime       = "nodejs14.x"
  role          = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec.arn
  environment {
    variables = {
      LOG_GROUP_NAME = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.lambda_logs.name
    }
  }
}
